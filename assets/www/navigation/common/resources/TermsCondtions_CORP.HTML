								system), Demand Draft or Manager's Cheque Service(s) ("Payment
								Service(s)"). It is understood that the Electronic Funds
								Transfer (or Demand Draft if sent to the beneficiary or the

								at the Customer's own risk. The Customer agrees to hold harmless
								and indemnify the Bank against any loss, costs, damages,
								expenses, liability or proceedings which the Customer may incur
								or suffer as a result of the Bank acting, delaying or refraining
								from acting upon the Customer's instruction(s). The Bank or the
								Bank's correspondent overseas shall not be liable for any loss,

								beneficiary's bank in collecting the remittance or encashing the
								Demand Draft. In no event shall the Bank under any circumstances

						<li><span>The Customer and each Authorised User agrees
								and understands that in the absence of specific instructions,
								all charges/commissions outside the UAE are for the
								beneficiary's account. The beneficiary may be unable to obtain
								full value under a Demand Draft/Electronic Funds Transfer on
								account of exchange or other restrictions applicable in the
								country of payment or to the paying bank or charges and fees of
								the payment bank. </span></li>
						<li><span>The Bank reserves the rights to send
								Electronic Funds Transfers through a place other than the one
								specified by the Customer if operational circumstances make this
								necessary. </span></li>
						<li><span>Encashment of the remittance sent by
								Electronic Funds Transfer or Demand Draft is subject to any

								shall be liable for any loss or delay caused by any such rules
								and regulations. </span></li>
						<li><span>The Bank will use reasonable endeavours to
								process applications for Payment Facilities received by the Bank
								before the specified Cut-off time specified by the receiving
								branches or centres from time to time. Applications received
								after such Cut-off time will be processed on the next working
								day. For this purpose all holidays and Fridays are non-working
								days. </span></li>
						<li><span>The beneficiary's bank BIC Code/Sort
								Code/Fed wire ID/CHIPS UID /ABA/IFSC/BSB or any such code
								mentioned by the Customer will be considered as correct and the
								remittance will be effected accordingly, assuming correctness of
								the given codes and the Bank shall not be responsible to check
								or verify that the codes are correct or match against the name
								of the beneficiary and shall not be liable for transfers
								effected pursuant to an incorrect code provided by the Customer.
						</span></li>
						<li><span>Electronic Funds Transfers will be effected
								with SPOT exchange rates (two business days after the date of
								receipt of request by the Bank). Applications for the same day
								value shall be made at the Bank's discretion, subject to receipt
								of the application prior to the relevant Cut-off time as
								determined by the Bank, as well as Cut-off times related to the
								geographical location of the payment destination. If the
								Customer or the Authorised User requests Electronic Funds
								Transfer between Accounts held with the Bank, the Bank may
								effect such transfers on receipt of instructions even if after
								the relevant Cut-off time (including where instructions are
								received outside normal banking hours) by applying the most
								recent SPOT exchange rate available to the Bank for the relevant
								currency. In the event that the exchange rate for that currency
								changes upon the re-opening of the Bank and/or the relevant
								currency market and this would result in a loss to the Bank, the
								Bank is entitled to debit the Customer's Account with the
								difference between the amount transferred calculated at the
								exchange rate applied to such Electronic Funds Transfer and the
								amount which would have been transferred had the exchange rate
								applicable on the re-opening of the Bank and/or the relevant
								currency market been applied to such Electronic Funds Transfer.
						</span></li>
						<li><span>The Bank reserves the right to revise all
								remittances fees and charges from time to time without prior

								indemnity acceptable to the Bank in connection with any request
								for the issue of a replacement or refund of the amount of such
								Demand Draft/Manager's Cheque and accepts that the Bank may take
								reasonable time to investigate non-payment of a Demand
								Draft/Manager's Cheque reported lost or stolen and the Bank is
								not liable to issue an immediate refund to the Customer or issue
								a replacement Demand Draft/Manager's Cheque. In a case where a
								Demand Draft is dispatched directly to the beneficiary or the
								beneficiary's bank, neither the Bank nor its correspondents are
								responsible for any delay, mistake or omission caused by any
								Postal Authority or Courier Company involved in the dispatch. </span></li>
						<li><span>If an Electronic Funds transfer instruction
								is submitted to the Bank by postal or messenger service or by
								fax (or otherwise than by the Customer in person), the Bank may
								act upon such authority ("instructions") and may presume that
								they are genuine and accurately represent the wishes of the
								Customer, even if the instructions are actually compiled or sent
								in error or by fraud or negligence or altered or amended by
								someone other than the Customer with or without the actual
								knowledge or instructions of the Customer. The Bank has no duty
								to verify the facts or genuineness of the Instructions. </span></li>
						<li><span>The Customer and each Authorised User agrees
								and accepts that if a refund of the remittance amount is desired
								from the Bank by the applicant or the remitted funds are
								returned by the correspondent bank, beneficiary's bank or other

								funds from the correspondent or beneficiary's bank, the Bank
								shall at its discretion make the payment to the applicant at the
								prevailing buying rate for the relevant currency less all
								charges and expenses as determined by the Bank in its absolute
								discretion.</span></li>
						<li><span>The Customer and each Authorised User agrees
								that the Bank may decline to make a payment it believes might
								involve a breach by any person of a law or regulations of any
								country or Bank's internal policies. A payment may be delayed or
								declined because a person involved in the payment or an
								authority/correspondent bank / beneficiary bank/ other
								intermediary bank requires information or clarification as to
								compliance with the law or regulations, or declines to process
								it. The Bank will share information as to your remittance, if
								necessary. </span></li>
						<li><span>The Customer and the Authorised User agrees
								to provide the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) of the
								beneficiary when the transfer is requested within UAE or outside
								UAE (wherever required in beneficiary's country) and understand
								that the Bank may decline to make a payment wherever IBAN is
								required in the beneficiary country. </span></li>
						<li><span>If the currency requested by the Customer is
								Chinese Yuan (CNY), the Customer and each Authorised User
								confirms that (a) the purpose of CNY remittance is trade-related
								only; (b) the account to be debited is a business entity
								account; (c) the beneficiary is a business entity and the
								beneficiary's bank is on the mainland of People's Republic of
								China; and (d) the Bank may any time require the Customer to
								provide copies of the trade documents related to the remittance.
								Failure to provide these documents or other information
								requested by the Bank with respect to the Transaction or if any
								of the above confirmations are incorrect may result into the
								Transaction being cancelled or funds being held in suspense
								and/or returned.</span></li>
